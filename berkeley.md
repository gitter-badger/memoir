# Berkeley, California

I moved to Berkeley in 1990 and lived in the San Francisco bay area for 11 years. While there I achieved two degrees at UC Berkeley, a BA attending from 1991-1994 with credit transferred from CU-Denver and CCD) and an MS from 1999-2001. From 1994 to 1999 I worked full-time at two companies each for three years: Grubb & Ellis, a commercial real estate broker, and Dolby Laboratories, a pioneering digital audio company.

## Oxford Street

I lived in a few locations in Berkeley, and briefly in San Francisco and Oakland. Eventually I found a rent-controlled studio on Oxford, a half-block to the Northwest corner of the UC Berkeley campus. I stayed there for 7 years with rents increasing by $10-20/year. When I first moved it the rent was expensive for my income (as a student working part-time in the middle of a recession) but later it was much more reasonable, both in relation to my income (a full-time employee) as well as relative to other rents in the area.

Oxford street was not the quietest neighborhood. I remember returning from a visit to Mexico, and my first thoughts on waking up was that the ocean was very loud and must be close (in fact, the sound  was from the automobile traffic outside).
