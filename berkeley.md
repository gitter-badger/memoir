# Berkeley (1990-2001)

I moved to Berkeley, California in 1990 and lived in the San Francisco bay area for 11 years. While there I achieved two degrees at UC Berkeley, a BA attending from 1991-1994 with credit transferred from CU-Denver and CCD) and an MS from 1999-2001. From 1994 to 1999 I worked full-time at two companies each for three years: Grubb & Ellis, a commercial real estate broker, and Dolby Laboratories, a pioneering digital audio company. There was a brief stint of consulting with the Aslan Consulting in mid 1997, but while it was lucrative and interesting, I felt better inside of a company as an employee (this feeling would change around 1999).

I have fond feelings for Berekely, some people there, as well as the urban and parkland environment, many restaurants, shops, and of course the University (beautiful and stimulating), as well as various gyms and performance places (Zellerbach hall). Berekely has problems of course: expensive, overcrowded, crime issues, pollution. And by the time I left I was ready for change, and was happy for a new adventure. Nevertheless, I still feel deeply connected to Berkeley and though it has now been more than 10 years since I was there (writing this in 2014).

## Oxford Street

I lived in a few locations in Berkeley, and briefly in San Francisco and Oakland. Eventually I found a rent-controlled studio on Oxford, a half-block to the Northwest corner of the UC Berkeley campus. I stayed there for 7 years with rents increasing by $10-20/year. When I first moved it the rent was expensive for my income (as a student working part-time in the middle of a recession) but later it was much more reasonable, both in relation to my income (a full-time employee) as well as relative to other rents in the area.

Oxford street was not the quietest neighborhood. I remember returning from a visit to Mexico, and my first thoughts on waking up was that the ocean was very loud and must be close (in fact, the sound  was from the automobile traffic outside).

## Places around Berkeley

It has been a long time since I was in Berkeley, so who knows if many of these places are still the same or even still existing. However, my memories of them have faded little over time.

### Indian Rock

...

### Zellerbach Hall

...

### Classical Music Store on Bancroft

...

### Spinning and Yoga classes at the UC Berkeley Recreational Sports Facility (RSF)

...

### Strawberry Creek, Eucalyptus Grove, Large tree south of the College of Environmental Design, view from the Campanile

Many of the natural parts of the UC Berkeley landscape (as well as physical buildings) are memorable. Of course much memory is built over time spent in these areas, so at first glance to the visitor they might not be much there.

### Berkeley Rose Garden and Cordonices Park

...

### Pizza in Berkeley, Oakland, SF

- Zachary's Pizza (Berekely, Oakland)
- Cheese Board Pizza (Berkeley)
- Pizza Rustica (Oakland)
- North Beach Pizza (SF)

Note that Fat Slice and Blondies are famous pizza places on/around Telegraph Avenue. I was never a fan of Blondies, and while I did eat Fat Slice on occasion, the other places mentioned are actually worth going to (rather than eating at because hungry/cheap prices).
