# Introduction

> I am of a healthy long lived race, and our minds improve with age. -- William Butler Yeats

The earliest stories I remember about my father's family name is that it came from Scotland, was associated with a castle, and earlier to a king called Niall of the Nine Hostages. After some research I found all of this to be either highly dubious or patently untrue. While much of these stories are true, they are not for everyone, and a name is not a history, and can hide history.

What follows is the story of my paternal line, traced through standard genealogy (the stories of families) and DNA analysis (Y-DNA). This story is meant to inform and entertain friends and family, and may help others in the search for their own genealogical and genetic histories.

For reasons that will become clear, a final chapter will be written in 2015 when a new addition to the family line is expected.

## The MacNeil name and Descent 

> Confusion can arise between this surname 'O'Neill' (otherwise 'Ua Neill') and the names 'Ui Neill' and 'MacNeill'. As a body, the descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages are often referred to by Annalists and historians as the 'Ui Neill', taking their name from him: included among the northern Ui Neill are the O'Donnell chieftains and the O'Neill and MacLochlainn Kings of Ailech, while the southern Ui Neill includes the O'Melaghlin Kings of Meath. The 'O'Neills' are a branch of the northern Ui Neill and take their name from the Niall 'Glundubh' who was killed in 919. The 'MacNeills' on the other hand, although claiming descent from both Niall 'Glundubh' and Niall of the Nine Hostages, take their name from a later and Scottish Niall.


## Years per Generation Averages

- Years per generation. As stated by historians, averages of 35-40 years occur so often as to be the norm in Irish and Highland history. 


### McNeill Patrilineal Generations 

- Daniel, b. 1630 d. 1684 (54 years)
- John, b. 1680, d. 1775 (85 years, father 50 at time of birth)
- Daniel, b. 1745, d. 1806 (61 years, father 65 at time of birth)
- Daniel, b. 1768, d. 1844 (76 years, father 23 at time of birth)
- Benjamin O. Seymour, b. 1808, d. 1890 (82 years, father 40 at time of birth)
- John Wilkison, b. 1851, d. 1940 (89 years, father 43 at time of birth)
- John Hanson, b. 1913, d. 1964 (51 years, father 54 at time of birth)
- Robert Bradley, b. 1941, d. ? (? years, father 28 at time of birth) - current age (2014) 73 years
- Jeff McNeill, b. 1966, d. ? (? years, father 25 at time of birth) - current age (2014) 48 years

- Father's age at birth: 50, 65, 23, 40, 43, 54, 28, 25 = 328/8 = average 41 years, median 42 years, range 23-65 years.
- Age at death: 54, 85, 61, 76, 82, 89, 51 = 498/7 = average 71 years, median 76 years, range 51-89 years.




## Ireland vs/and Scotland (and Northern Ireland)

> it is in general true that from the time of the earliest records until the wars of Montrose in the seventeenth-century Gaelic Scotland and Gaelic Ireland, sharing common traditions and a common language, were in constant cultural and political contact.

The current history of Ireland vs. Northern Ireland is seen as one of foreign oppression (on the one hand) and a long linneage of possession (on the other). It is also colored by relgious differences. It is certainly the case that previous to English plantations, the history of the region was just as contentious and bloody, and common language and culture did not render it any less so.


## The Pedigree of the MacNeil of Barra

MacNeil of Barra is said to be descended from Nial of the Nine Hostages, and *Castle on the Sea* and the arrival of MacNeil to Barra is set at 1030 CE. Both of these claims have a single origin with no historical corroborration. Don't go telling people of Barra that this might not be so, but for the historical record there is no evidence. Indeed as well the claim that Barra MacNeil was the chief of all MacNeil/McNeill is obviously false. Whether the MacNeil at Colonsay and Gigha is related is also unclear.


## MacNeil YDNA Analysis

The relations between the islands can be analyzed via YDNA, and there is a group with reports from the various islands. Unfortunately sample size is fairly small from the smaller islands:

- [Descriptive results for MacNeil family group in FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com/public/MacNeil/default.aspx?section=results)
- [Color-coded, ordered YDNA data ro the MacNeil family](https://www.familytreedna.com/public/MacNeil/default.aspx?vgroup=MacNeil&section=ycolorized)

It appears that those outside of Barra have DNA differences which indicate a separate (though of course somewhat related) genealogy.


## YDNA Analysis (also MTDNA Analysis)

- Note see also [relative distribution of YDNA values for select subgroups](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~geneticgenealogy/yfreq.htm) to understand value likelihood. Also, some locations are subject to higher mutation rates, though I have not found a resource which provides these location/rates.



Hello Dad and Susan,

This is a fascinating subject. About five years ago I spend a bit of time diving into this. Here is my current understanding and previous findings. Attached is a PDF showing the line as far back as I've been able to get, but things get murky fairly quickly.


## Genealogical Research and DNA Testing

I did a bunch of genealogical research a few years ago, and got a pretty good picture of things. I've also done research using Y-DNA haplotyping. While genealogy is about families and descent, the haplotype research is based on genetic evolution and has a much longer time scale (at the order of hundreds to thousands of years). I've had 67 markers tested on our Y chromosome (passed down from fathers to sons).

One of our relations is doing both genealogical and haplotype research, and you may want to get in touch with her. If I recall correctly, she has been involved in running a McNeill family newsletter/clan association. Her name is Gwen McNeill and she is at gigigamac@comcast.net. 

The haplotype information for the "MacNeil" names is at http://www.familytreedna.com/public/MacNeil/

GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH ISSUES
One problem with genealogical research is that for many people, there was no single common spelling. I've actually seen documents signed by our emigrant ancestor, and he signed with an X. He was illiterate. And his name was written in different ways at different times on different documents and in different records. This has resulted in our family having relatives who have a different spelling of their last name.

Then there is the whole problem of associating a name to a place, and also to an ethnic grouping. For example, the emigrant ancestor was likely born and living in Coleraine, Northern Ireland. But was he Irish or English or Scottish? This is not clear and we cannot be sure with the evidence we have.

On the Haplotype side, there are no matches with the McNeill/MacNeil's of either Barra, Gigha, or Colonsay. This means that his name could have been an adopted name, or changed, or there was a "non-paternity event", as they call it. 

The best match is a 67-1 who charts their ancestor back to a William English (1774); Co Antrim, Ireland. Other close matches are more common in Ireland and Northern Ireland than Scotland and England.

GENEALOGY RESEARCH (Note: This was done April, 2007, so I am not sure about all the links below.)

Here are some things I have found regarding our genealogy both traditional and genetic:

Question: are we Scot or Irish?

Our emigrant ancestor is John McNeill (1680-1765) born in Coleraine, Ireland (Northern Ireland, during the Plantation scheme), emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1722. His father Daniel McNeill was also born in Coleraine, Ireland, but I only have a date range for his birth and death. b. 1629/1658 d.1683/1743. Another record has his birth and death at 1630 to 1684 (his son John being 4 years old at his father's death)

Other than that, I have narrowed the probabilities of our pre-emigrant
ancestors to the following:

Daniel McNeill b.1629/1658 in/of Coleraine

Daniel's father could be...

- Presbyterian Scots Ulster settler (1611-1630) (of the 100,000 scots settlers)
- Scottish military quartered there (1642-1650) (of the 10,000 troops under Munroe brought to fight the Irish Confederate war)
- Native Irish converted to Presbyterianism (this is not unlikely and sometimes the only thing that needed doing was changing of O'Neill to McNeill...)

Daniel's son John, our emigrant ancestor, was born in Coleraine in 1680, emigrated in 1722 (this was part of a large emigration due to financial pressures on Presbyterians that began around 1717/1719) 

John married in 1744 (yes, at age 64) in a Presbyterian church in Philadelphia, and later migrated to Northern Virginia (dying at 85 after raising three boys). If he was Presbyterian when he emigrated, then he may be an Ulster Scot. 

As we know, McNeill (and variant spellings) are associated with three islands in the Scot Hebrides: Barra, Colonsay, and Gigha, but none of the sequencing done in those places are turning out matches for us (granted, sample size is small). 

So, short answer is I don't really know! Scots-Irish is likely the best tentative description. Turns out this group we were in made up 20% of the American colonies at the time of the American Revolution, and is pretty much the hard scrapping, kick-ass settlers of Ulster and the United States, carving it out of chaos. 

http://www.ulsterancestry.com/ulster-scots.html

Ulster Scot may be the right title, but for sure our ancestors came from Ireland, but for how many generations were they there? And the Scots came from Ireland before that anyway, in the 5th and 6th centuries, so it is hard to fix things in a given nationality/ethnicity. Basically, we are having to rethink different ethnic identity, esp. in that part of the world. For example: 

http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=1393742006

and especially this excellent discussion:

http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~merle/History/SI-History.htm
Here are some additional resources that may be of interest:

http://del.icio.us/jeffmcneill/scotland/ (not all Scottish, but that is the tag I am using, these are my bookmarks, some stuff on McNeill, post Ireland departure)

As far as the Haplotype goes, I've done the 67 marker test and this is the current haplotype finding: Confirmed Haplogroup: R1b1a2a1a1a Shorthand: R-U106

This Haplogroup is common with density in Germany, Austria and peaks in the Netherlands (35%). If we go back earlier things get sketchy, because individual ancestry is difficult to parse out.

Maybe not even Irish, but Dutch...? Who knows?




Wow! Reading all of this makes even a McNeill's head spin. I was completely attached to the notion that we were from Scotland (even hankering to visit ye old family castle) but now I have my doubts! What are we?!
Thank you so much for sharing this everyone.




Hi,
The McNeills always claimed to be from Scotland.  When I visited Scotland a few years ago and went through the Highlands and the Battlefield of Culloden (where the English defeated the Highlanders and ended the Jacobite Rising), the prevailing story was that in the 1600s and the 1700s the English did the "Clearances", they drove the clans off their lands.  The displaced Scots migrated to Northern Ireland, then later to the US, which is why they are called Scot Irish.  The English and Scots met at Culloden in 1746, so that's beyond the time the McNeills showed up in Northern Ireland.  I did some research at the McDonald castle in Scotland where all the immigration records are kept and found no Daniel McNeill immigrated from Scotland.  I suspect Daniel is the son of a displaced Scot who went to Northern Ireland.  After I finish the US family history (McNeill/Pancake/Frost), I'll tackle that subject.  The Pancakes have an interesting history and it is intertwined with the McNeills, both families were in the same county in Ohio, etc.  Also, the Frosts (who founded Frostburg, MD) are an interesting lot, with roots going back to the Winthropes in England.  The Frosts were from Suffolk, England -- weren't on the Mayflower but arrived in US in 1636 and settled in Cambridge, MA.  When I complete their stories, I'll forward it on. 





Hello all,

A couple more points come to mind.

I think it is wise to focus on different families and their interactions and interrelations. Even for the McNeill's we are descended both patrilineally and matrilineally from two of the three sons of our emigrant ancestor. One son is our direct patrilineal ancestor and another came back through various families to merge back in through marriage.

Regarding Scottish vs. Irish, there have been in the past a lot of discrimination of the Irish in the US, and at some point I think some of our other ancestors may have even changed their name to avoid this. 

When dealing with this line of direct male descendants, it is important to keep in mind that this is one small fraction of our total genetic and genealogical heritage. But the Y-DNA and MT-DNA allows for direct matrilineal and direct patrilineal mapping. 

There was another website I found back many years ago which allowed people to see each other's genealogical lines and add what was shared into their own lineage. This was great because we have some ancestors which have a very detailed and historical line. Of course this makes sense since in the past there was a much smaller population, and those who were much more likely to have offspring that survived and had children themselves had the means to document their family lines. Surfing through those connections I recall being able to go back to some early Irish kings around the second century. Not the patrilineal direct line, but still ancestors nonetheless.

Here in the Thailand and neighbor countries it is fascinating how some of the hill tribes (who are very ancient peoples) have practices to ensure no inbreeding. For example, among most hill tribes, the boys and girls in a village do not date or mate, but they have to go to another village for courtship. In addition, it is common practice that the wife leaves her village and goes to live in the village of the husband. Also, some groups, such as the Hmong, actually have had family names for a long time (which is uncommon in most of the world) and those with the same family name were not allowed to marry. Finally, some hill tribes (e.g., the Lahu) actually have a common practice, only now disappearing, which is to sell the female children when they are still infants (to different hill tribes/ethnic groups altogether). These girls are then raised into a different culture altogether, kind of a comprehensive adoption policy. Quite a (to us) bizarre cultural practice which has the result of making any actual genetic tracing (along matrilineal lines) impossible. 





Yes, my maternial grandfather, Hayes Bradley, is an example of Irish name changing, as his family name was changed from O'Brady during immigration to this country to avoid discrination against the Irish -- I guess that there was a relative somewhere with the nice sounding name of Bradley.



Jeff,
You are absolutely correct about the discrimination of the Irish in the US -- Mom told me one time that the Bradleys changed their name from O'Brady to Bradley because of the discrimination.  Of course later when I asked her about it again, she denied it and none of the Bradleys today seem aware that they are not of English descent but are Irish.  One of the reasons I can be fairly confident of the McNeill line in US is I was around when some of the older McNeills talked and I remember most everything they said. I can remember going to the Rinkers' house (we had to park on side of road and walk down to their house as they did not have vehicles.  My Dad and I used to deliver baskets of fresh fruit to the McNeill relatives who lived beyond roads, some had those old fashion non-electrical washing machines on the front porch.  Grandma (Sallie E Pancake) and I visited Kate's house -- the gate and driveway up to the house (about a half mile) was grown over and hadn't been used for years.  I saw the man Kate lived with but was never introduced to him.  Your Dad was not included in these visits so he doesn't have the same memories as I do.  I wanted to do the histories before I'm gone and all those memories are gone with me.




Just a small detail on connecting the dots. Daniel McNeill, the father of John McNeill (our emigrant ancestor) was born in (or lived in) Coleraine, Northern Ireland. So it was his parent(s) who emigrated to Ireland (or his grandparents, etc.), if they did.. So I think we are dealing with the first half of the 17 century for getting to Ireland (at the earliest), and again only if they did. Fascinating stuff. 

It took a long time to finally get behind John to get some detail. I forget where exactly I tracked that down. There are some graveyard headstone records I found at one point. I really think the mystery could be sorted out in Northern Ireland. Someday I'll get over there!

BTW, last year I got this information from someone on the Y-DNA project. Feel free to follow up with the person below. I actually never did (though I should have)...


===============

I have received a request from Mary McNeill Ramage that you contact her, please.

She saw the account of your family that appears on our MacNeil DNA Project website and feels there may be a connection.

I'm afraid she only has snail mail, her address is:

Mrs Mary McNeill Ramage,
31 Gortamaddy Drive,
Ballycastle,
Co.Antrim,
Northern Ireland
BT54 6RZ

I recommended that she test a male family member if she wants to know her relationship to others, so I hope she does that and
it will answer her immediate questions. I don't know if they would match your "Antrim R1b" signature, if not then there is
obviously no connection.

## Genetic Genealogy

Genetic Genealogy is the study of families using analysis of DNA. There are two kinds of DNA to study this, YDNA is part of the Y chromosome (passed from fathers to sons), and MTDNA which is passed on from Mothers to their children. Both males and females have X chromosomes (females have two, one from each parent), whereas males have an X and a Y, which is why good genetic tests are done with DNA from males. For females who want testing, it is most accurately done with DNA from a male sibling who share both parents.

Genetic Genealogy deals with hundreds to thousands of years, whereas genealogy alone (the stories of families) best deals with tens to hundreds of years (10 generations or so). One thing about genealogy is that stories can be wrong (and so-called non-paternity events can take place, where the actual father of a child is not known or hidden). 

Genetic Genealogy can't lie, as long as samples are taken accurately and not contaminated. However, it is less accurate as we are dealing with a longer time scale and the variability of mutation.


## Companies doing Genetic Genealogy

There are several companies doing genetic testing. 

- [National Geographics Genographic project](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/) uses the FTDNA kit and analysis
- [Family Tree DNA](https://my.familytreedna.com/) (My Kit is # 84839)
- [23andme](http://23andme.com) has a lot of bad reviews (on Amazon and elsewhere)
- [Ancestry.com](http://dna.ancestry.com/) has also bad reviews, but its pricing model may have improved. They claim a large number of tests for their product

I started with FTDNA, as at the time they were one of the only DNA testers on the market. Over time I have added additional tests, and more information and matches flow from the project. This is still an active area of science so new discoveries create new tests (which cost more money for further information).

I might try Ancestry.com instead if I were just starting out. 23andme sounds a bit scary of an organization and there is so little information on the website, it feels like a scam. One thing about FTDNA is that you are provided little interpretation and a lot of data (which is what I prefer). 


## Haplogroup, Haplotype, Deep Clade

The [R Hapologroup (M207)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R-M207) is the root Haplogroup for the McNeill YDNA, whereas the [O Haplogroup (M)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_O_(Y-DNA)) is the root for East and Southeast Asia. In particular, we are [R1b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1b_(Y-DNA)), and more specifically [R1b1a2a1a1a aka U106](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1b_(Y-DNA)#R1b1a2a1a1a_.28R-U106.29). R-U106 is quite common, present in 25% of the R1b. Note that this is *not* the subclade of [Niall of the Nine Hostages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_of_the_Nine_Hostages).

Since my last analysis, there have been more subclades discovered under U106, perhaps a few dozen possibilities. Another closely mapped individual has an *R-Z2* designation, which we may belong to as well, or one of its dozen or so subclades.

## An Overview of Human Evolution and Genetic Genealogy (and Culture)

The basic idea is that the human species may be 200,000 years old or so (though alternative approaches make claims of up to 1 million years), with full human modern behavior (culture, from the anthropological perspective) around 50,000 years ago. The surviving species emerged from Africa after the [Toba Eruption Event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_eruption) around 69-77,000 years ago. Toba is suggested as a near-extinction event, which could have killed off any others. 

Whatever the cause (Toba event or not) there is a known *hourglass* or *bottleneck* where the human species was reduced to around [10,000 breeding pairs](http://www.pnas.org/content/95/4/1961.full) (some say 7,000).

Africa may not have been the original place of origin of the species, but was the starting point after *Toba/hourglass*. Most Haplogroup time estimates are shorter than 50,000 years, and so here we enter the genetic genealogical time frame. Humans took up [different routes at different times out of Africa](https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html), and this kind of haplogroup wandering can be found in the fossil record.

Some time around 10-12,000 years ago some human groups left the hunting and gathering lifestyle and innovated with wild grains but turned into true agriculture (and animal husbandry, which may have occurred before then).

Around 5-6,000 years ago the [Bronze Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) ushered in advanced mining, smelting and metalworking. Evidence of Bronze technology continued as late as 500 CE, such as in Thailand. 

Around 5,000 years ago writing technology also first appeared (in Egypt). In backwards places like Ireland, script such as [Ogham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham) could be a little over 2,000 years old, about the same time that the Buddhist canon was being committed to writing in Pali. Cham in Vietnam was around 1,800 years ago. Khmer had a script (based on Pallavi) around 1,500 years ago. Written Myanmar, Thai and Vietnamese writing is of more recent origins, around 700-800 years ago (possibly a little longer).

Six hundred years ago, the [moveable type printing press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) came into existence, having an enormous impact on literacy, and hence human culture and behavior.

Now, we come up to the genealogy of the McNeill, since we know that the emigrant ancestor John McNeill was illiterate but his sons (born in/after 1745) were not. This is nearly 300 years ago. The genetic genealogy, however, reaches back to the earliest emigration out of Africa, and calculations can be done to ascertain the relative relatedness of others with genetic testing.

## Brief History of Ulster, Northern Ireland

Early in 1600s -- around 1600 the English decided to *plantation* the numerous Scots to Northern Ireland.  The McNeills are on the List of Scots plantationed to Londonderry/Derry.  The reason for this system was two-fold: 

- Get rid of the low land Scots and repopulate with English. 
- Populate Ireland with Protestant loyalists and get rid of Roman Catholic majority.  

Cold and harsh but that's how the English operated, and you can see the seeds of the IRA being sown.  The English continued to "get rid" of Scots with the Highland Clearances for the next two centuries.  After the battle of Cullodun, the English forbid any Highlander from wearing the tartan and kilt.  If anyone was seen wearing their tartan, the English solider would find them and beat them to death.  The Highlanders were forbidden any type of weapon and again the penalty was death.  

BTW: We are the McNeills of Colonsay not of Bara.  The home was on the Inner Hebrides Island Giga.  The McNeill lost control of Giga to the stronger Campbells. The McNeill seal motto is Vincere Aut Mort (Conquer or Die).  I discovered this information when I was in Scotland.

The McNeills got into trouble with the English because they supported the clan Campbell (1500/1600s) and fought a battle and got fined: Lachlann McNeil (1,000 pounds) and Neil Og McNeill (300 pounds).

So the simple answer is we are Scottish but not from main clan. 





Unfortunately I have to make this a bit more complicated. This is due to my research using DNA methods. One part of the Y dna structure (passed down father to son) is meaningless genetically (think of it like packing material in a box), but useful for tracking change over time, based on some models of mutation rates.

I've had this testing done (one takes a scraping of the inside of their mouth and send it to the lab, and they do analysis for a fee, with follow on analyses available over time as progress in the research is made).

Our DNA does not correspond to any other known population of McNeills (Gigha, Barra, Colonsay, Taynish Argyll) based on current samples (and there are more than a few at this point). That means we are not genetically related patrilineally to those McNeills. And we are not descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages (who was quite otherwise prolific). 

Non-Paternity Events are when someone is descended from someone else than they thought. The individual's genetic father is not the same as who raised them as their father. Some researchers put this around 1-5% of each generation (!!!). And in many cases the offspring are unaware of this fact. We have to take into consideration that this could be the case nearly everywhere along the path back into the past.

Family names can be given to non-genetic offspring either through adoption or other kinds of family affiliation. In the case of Ireland/Scotland, apparently last names were an innovation around the 11th century. Also, they were not consistently spelled one way, but were largely phonetic transcriptions (most people being functionally illiterate and living in a largely spoken culture). Changing one's last name was easier to do, and for various reasons, much different than in the USA today. 

Here in Thailand, it is one of the easiest things to change one's name, both first and surname. This is not uncommon, especially if someone starts having a lot of bad luck. The thinking is that some naughty spirit or ghost is causing trouble. These spirits are a little dim-witted, so if you change your name, they lose track of you, and the troubles go away. This is a part of the culture and I personally know people who have done this (adults).
In addition, the genealogical stories themselves that we have are not necessarily accurate. Some are half-truths, wishful thinking, half-remembered, or outright deceptions. The McNeill pedigree is tenuous, from a historical perspective. See especially: http://web.archive.org/web/20070126093733/http://members.aol.com/Lochlan6/sellar.htm (I'm adding the relevant point at the bottom of this email from this source).

We have to also recall that this kind of genealogical research and interest (and the tools we have at our disposal) was simply a foreign concept even 100 years ago. It is true that families have always told their story to each succeeding generation, but written chronicles preserved over time belong to a much smaller number of families that existed. Those stories become distorted, or changed either willfully or through simple error.
And so, in sum, one or more of the following occurred:

- Non-paternity event(s)
- Took on the name McNeill from a different name, either to change our origins, fit in with a community, or were adopted into a family or community where that would be common to do. Perhaps even took on the name as a servant to the family, again not uncommon.
- Lived many or few generations as a McNeill. (We are however conclusively unrelated genetically to the McNeills of various Scottish locations, who have so far been genetically tested for Y-DNA markers.)

Unfortunately, we cannot know at this point the whole story. Indeed we could have had non-paternity events in the US after emigration, and while the genealogy is correct, the genetic history is off. The truth is somewhere out there. When the genealogy and the genetic history match up, then we will have at last a credible family history (or at least a part of it).

===========

Although the traditional MacNeill descent is now perhaps the best known of all the families considered, it is by far the least well supported by documentary evidence. Indeed the crucial links in the MacNeill pedigree appear to rest, incredible though it may seem, on the authority of two crofters living in Barra at the turn of the century. This pedigree as recorded by R. L. MacNeil traces the descent of the Barra MacNeils from 'Niall son of Muirceartach, son of Donal, son of Aodh, son of Niall, son of Aodh Alaind, son of Aodh Aonrachan, son of Aodh Athlamh, son of Flathartach'. Although the names are clearly garbled and although MacNeil's account of the early history of his clan is, to say the least, highly questionable, there can be little doubt that the Barra MacNeils claimed the same descent as the Cowal and Knapdale families. No traditional pedigree of the MacNeills of Taynish and Gigha has survived but it seems more than likely that they descend from the same parent stem as the Barra MacNeils.

Against this view it is sometimes argued, following A. MacLean Sinclair, that the two families of MacNeill are not related and have separate origins (Sinclair 1906-7; 1901-10). MacLean Sinclair, however, cannot be relied on in this matter: be gives hardly any authority for his views, which involve taking a pedigree in MS. 1467 thought by Skene to be that of the MacLennans for that of the MacNeils of Barra and tacking the MacNeills of Taynish and Gigha on to the MacLeans. In view of the Cowal and Knapdale associations the claim of MacNeil of Barra to be chief of all Clan Neill does not appear to be beyond question and the date given in Castle in the Sea for the arrival of the first MacNeil ancestor in Barra c. 1030 A.D.) cannot be accepted. The Clan Neill, in any case, would appear to have been a junior branch of the descendants of Aodh Alainn, distinctly overshadowed in the thirteenth century by the MacSweens, the Lamonts and the descendants of Gilchrist.

## History of the Scotch-Irish or Ulster Scott

- [History of the Scotch-Irish or Ulster Scot](http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~merle/History/SI-History.htm)

> WARNING: do not confuse history with family history. History describes events of significance to the nation and mass migrations. Family history describes a single family or individual's history. It is very possible your family is different from the history described below. Mine is! That doesn't mean that either the historians or your grannie is wrong. You do need to be aware of the big picture to do well with family history. Many a brick wall is composed of erroneous assumptions.


### Scotland

> Most Ulster Scots were in Scotland before they migrated to Ireland. MOST but not ALL.. We'll discuss where else they might have been later. But for now, where were they in Scotland and when did they move to Ireland and why?

> Most of them were in areas of Scotland adjacent to Ireland. The largest migration of Scots to Ireland was in the early 1600's. Due to lack of definitive records, we do not have exact numbers, but in the early 1600's 120,000 are believed to have migrated -- from both England and Scotland. Bailyn says in one 24 month period in the 1630's at least 10,000 Scots migrated to Ireland (Bailyn, Bernard. The Peopling of British North America: An Introduction, Vintage Books, 1988, p 26).

> In the early 1600's Ireland was the primary destination for migrating Scots because it provided opportunities that Scotland couldn't offer-- and Scots were not welcome in English colonies. Protestants were welcome. Catholic Scots, of which there are many, were not welcomed by the government in Ireland, though some did come, largely at the behest of Scottish Catholic lords, on whose lands in Scotland they may have already been living. But the bulk were Presbyterian lowlanders. They include a group of Protestant lowlanders that the Scottish government settled in Kintyre. They were run off by hostile natives and sheltered by Sir Randal McDonald (Catholic) on his lands in Antrim. He appreciated the lowland farmer. This group were a few of the many victims of the McDonald/Campbell feud.

> Many tenant farmers came from Ayrshire -- though Ireland attracted enterprising landlords and merchants from all over Scotland. Other Scots had come from Argyle and other McDonald homelands in the mid 1500's with the McDonalds. Many of them were Catholic. They are still settled in the Glens of Antrim. Many are ethnically Irish because they are Catholic.

> Another source of Scottish and English settlers was the Scottish/English border. At the time, James I/VI was breaking up those clans to secure the border between the two countries. Many fled hanging in England or Scotland to Ireland, largely settling in Fermanagh. Often lords acquiring lands in Ireland recruited from their own Scottish estates or the estates of their neighbors, relatives, and friends. An unknown number of Scots fled back to Scotland in the 1630's to avoid religious persecution in Scotland.


### Ulster

> In the early 1600's the Scots joined a small Irish population. Since poor Ulster had been decimated by more than 50 years of war at the time of the Plantations there were not many Irish. AND, contrary to popular belief, they were not "run off". If you doubt me, read Elliott The Catholics of Ulster --or any number of history books. True, the government WANTED to run them off and pursue a "Cherokee" type solution. However they were very short of men to farm and bring in the harvests. They could not afford to displace the Irish as their lives depended on them staying to bring in the harvests.Though the law prohibited the newcomers from renting to Irish, many did anyway. The Church (Protestant) was under no such restraints so many of its tenants were Irish.

> The Ulster Irish spoke of course Irish, which was simply a different dialect of Gaelic. Scots and Irish could communicate without difficulty. This isn't surprising since the Scotti, an Irish tribe, moved from Ireland originally. They also followed similar naming patterns to the Irish. There were sons of Hughs, Johns, and James everywhere. So they sometimes ended up with the same or similar surnames as the incoming Scots.

> Due to the destruction caused by war, there were no habitable houses. All the churches were in ruin. There were very few priests or Protestant clergy. It is documented that in at least one Antrim parish the entire Irish population became Presbyterian because the only minister about was the Scottish Presbyterian minister. If you wanted the baby baptized, he did it. In a world where religion was not yet politicized, this happened without communal pressure -- in some locations.

> In 1641 many Ulster Scots were killed by the Irish in the Rising, but we are not sure how many. We do not know how many people were in Ulster as many had fled to Scotland in the 1630's to avoid the Black Oath. In 1642 more Scots arrived to defend the survivors as part of Monroe's army. It founded the first Presbyterian presbytery in Ireland. Before that, there was none. Though Presbyterian, not all these men were lowlanders. I have an ancestor who presumably arrived in 1642 in Monroe's army. He came from Kintyre and was a Lamont, though the surname of his descendants is BLACK. They settled into Antrim.

> In the 1680's more Scots came to Ireland, fleeing the Killing Times in south western Scotland. In the late 1690's another period of enhanced Scots immigration to Ireland occurred after King William secured his throne. Apparently whole new towns and villages sprang up at this time. There is also evidence of a famine in Scotland which caused increased migration.

> After the Williamite Settlement there were no large movements of Scots to Ireland because economic conditions in Ireland were not good. Sometimes they fled to Ireland to avoid religious persecution, though sometimes they fled back to Scotland to escape it in Ireland. People also moved in both directions at various times to avoid political problems. People also migrated seasonally to Scotland to work on farms.


### Non-Scots Ulster Scots

> However not all *Ulster Scots* were from Scotland. Assimilating into this ethnic group, which has become synonymous for Presbyterians in Northern Ireland, were the English settlers of the Ulster Plantations. The English did not survive well in the tough climate of Ulster in the early 1600's. The Scots tended to replace them even in the English Plantations.

> Other English/Welsh blood was donated by the Chichesters, who started a colony of their tenants in Antrim from their lands in Devon and Wales in the later 1500's. This is called the "Lost English Colony". The surnames remain in the Belfast area.

> Also you have other immigrants such as the Thompson family, who emigrated from Holland. They became a prominent Belfast merchant family. After 1690 many of King William's continental soldiers settled in Ireland. Not too many of Cromwell's soldiers were settled in Ulster since it already was largely in the hands of loyal Protestants.

> Protestants such as Huguenots and Germans also settled in Ireland in the 1600's. Many of these settled elsewhere in Ireland than Ulster, though there were settlements of Germans in Antrim and Huguenots in Lisburn -- as well as others.

> The surnames of the non-British settlers rapidly became anglicized so that they can be difficult to identify by surname alone.

> Finally Irish assimilated into the Ulster Scots ethnic group. As Irish converted to Protestantism, descendants assumed their families came from Scotland as they adopted the myths of the Ulster Scot as their own. However some don't. Surnames were fluid. Adopting a new ethnic identity was very simple: drop the O. Some Irish surnames began with Mac as well as Scots. By dropping the Mac, the name was anglicized and indistinguishable from English surnames.

> In the 1600's there appears to have been an ethnic fluidity in Ireland. Your *ethnicity* was determined more by your choice of religion rather than your ancestrage. In some areas in south Antrim, it is believed that, due to lack of both Catholic and Church of Ireland clergy and the presence of Gaelic-speaking Presbyterian clergy, the indigenous population became Presbyterian by default. The first Presbyterian minister in Bushmills was an Irishman named O'Quinn in the early 1600's. He preached in Irish to his congregation and went on missions to convert the Irish. Evidence remains that the Scottish Presbyterians maintained an active ministry in Irish though this became impossible to maintain due to the government policies outlawing the use of Irish. Meanwhile Scottish men were marrying Irish women -- who raised their offspring Catholic and Irish speaking. In fact, when the law was repealed in the early 1600's which made it illegal for Scots to marry Irish, we are told there was *great rejoicing*.

> Let none of this of course detract from your current ethnic tag. We are who were are; our ancestors, however, may well have been something different. At one time they were Strathclydians, Mercians, Northumberlanders or Irish or Scots warriors fighting with Irish or Scots warriors of differing clans. These kingdoms and the clan rivalries are forgotten though at one time their inhabitants fought bitterly with one another to establish their cultures in Great Britain. In fact, the Scotti of Roman days were an Irish clan -- from County Antrim. They later invaded Scotland (500 AD) and won the local cultural battle with the Picts.

> As long as Ireland and Scotland have been next to each other, there's been migration between the two to adjacent areas. Ulster is adjacent to Scotland -- so that's where many Scots went. It was easy to go over and come back again.

> Often it was difficult to tell a Scot from an Irish because in many cases, they shared a common culture and spoke a common tongue. They had similar cultures. Many Scots clans are founded by Irish clans. In fact, Scotland is a colony of Ireland. Before 500 AD the "Scotti" were in Ireland. Scotland was called "Alba" then and Picts lived there. The Scotti established a colony on the western shores. Eventually these Antrim boys lost their lands in Ireland to marauding Irish clans, but they supplanted the Picts. Kenneth McAlpin united the thrones of the Picts and Scots. However the eastern lowlanders were a different people. They are the descendants of Angles and Vikings and Pictish clans, not the Irish Scotti.

> In the late Middle Ages a new phenomena began to occur that would have a massive impact on Ireland. Irish lords began to hire Scottish mercenaries to help fight their intertribal and wars with the English. They were called Galloglass soldiers from the Irish gall oglaigh or stranger soldiers. They were apparently from the western Scotland and of mixed Scots and Viking origin. They changed the course of history in the 1500's. Through one dynastic marriage an Irish lord got 10,000 of these soldiers. Some of them settled down in Ireland and established clans of their own. The McSweenies are one example of a galloglass clan who assimilated into the Irish. If they stayed Catholic, they assimilated into the Irish and lost their ethnic identity as Scots.

> As mentioned, the majority of the Ulster Scots came in the Ulster Plantation period. They came willingly, recruited by their lairds, many of whom were also acquiring Irish estates. Their forte was not only farming but also the skilled labor required to create a colony. They could build homes, raise livestock, blacksmith, and so on.


## Seventeen Hundreds

> Much of the text on this page has focused on the sixteen hundreds since it was the formative period of the Ulster Scots. It was also a very turbulent hundred years in Ireland. Nonetheless, Scots didn't attempt to emigrate to the Americas in any large numbers. A few did leave. In fact Rev Mckemie began the Presbyterian Church in America. However most didn't leave till the 1700's.

> In the early 1700's the political situation in Ireland stabilized. There would be no more rebellions till 1798. However economic conditions worsened, at least partially due to trade restrictions placed on the economy by Parliament.These laws also impacted the Scottish economy. Consequently Ireland was no longer an attractive destination for immigrants.

> While in the 1600's the Presbyterians were persecuted and neither they or Catholics worshipped in churches, as the Penal Laws were reduced in the 1700's, they began to construct churches, called meeting houses. While in the 1600's it was common for families to move to new farms frequently, in the 1700's people "settled down" and attempted to hold onto the lease that they'd had. Thrown into competition over reduced resources, Irish and Scots began to conflict locally. For instance the Hearts of Oak disturbance.

> The great wave of emigration of Ulster Scots to American began in 1718 and continued till the start of the American Revolution.


## Names and Clans

The clan structure in Scotland may be the answer. Clans in Scotland were formed of the Chief and under him were a number of unrelated people who took as their [patronymic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic) the clan name and often first names of the Chief and his family. The family of Daniel McNeill, father of emigrant John McNeill, may have looked to one of the clans with the name of McNeill/MacNeil of Ireland, or the Islands for protection and as part of the unemployed and landless masses where were forced to move to Ulster Londonderry/Antrim County during the second wave of *Plantations*. Parts of the (various) McNeill clans were listed as part of the plantation effort to Londonderry. Records of these resettled McNeills don't exist in Northern Ireland until the 1800s -- long after John McNeill left for America.
